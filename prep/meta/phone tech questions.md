You'll solve two coding problems focused on CS fundamentals like algorithms,
data structures, recursions, and binary trees. If your tech screen is by phone, the
engineer will send you a collaborative editor (such as coderpad.io). If your tech
screen is in person, you'll use a whiteboard.

* Block out time every day to write code. Target medium and hard problems.
* It’s much better to practice solving fewer example problems of many problem types than to
*

The password for the two videos above is "FB_IPS". Portions of the videos that
cover soft skills tips may be more relevant for preparing for your onsite interview
than for preparing for your initial tech screen.

Data structures, particularly those used most often (array,
stack/queue, hashset/hashmap/hashtable/dictionary, tree/binary
tree, heap, graph, etc.)

O memory constraints on the complexity of the algorithm you’re
writing and its running time as expressed by big-O notation

Everyone could use a refresher in at least one core area! Before your initial tech
screen, brush up on CS fundamentals— especially algorithms, data structures,
object-oriented design, and design patterns in general. Review foundational
techniques—recursion, graph theory, tree traversal, combinatorial problems, and
so on.

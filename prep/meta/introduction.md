I'm Jevin Anderson. I'm from Missouri originally. I attended the University of Missouri, Columbia. Mizzou.
I've been doing software development for ten years. I've worked in the fields of GIS, recruiting, FINTECH,
and cloud services. I've been in california since 2017, where I started at PayPal doing credit work. I
moved to AWS where I worked on the Home page. There I worked in improving performance, implementing visual
refreshes, and various features. I'm interested in Meta for your contributions to VR and frontend technologies.
During covid, my wife's pregnancies, and now as a single dad with my kids I've used the VR to workout with
supernatural. The coaches are easy and accessible and I can use it to fulfill my exerecise routies while
my kids sleep. I enjoy it. An avid gamer, I loved playing VR games such as Vader unleashed. I think it's
the future of games, and has a potential to get people off of their couches.

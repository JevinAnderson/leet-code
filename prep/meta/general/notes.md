Array
Linked Lists
Stacks

Trees
  1. Binary tree -> each node two children
  2. Binary search tree -> parent node is greater than all of it's left children and smaller than all of it's right children
  3. Heap -> no order, but parent node is always larger or smaller than all of it's children
  4. Tries -> string trees, autocomplete setup
